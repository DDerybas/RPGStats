New stat types are added via **RMB in the project folder -> Create -> Stat Type**. This is done for convenience so as not to use enumerations, since this would require recompiling the code every time a stat is added/removed.
Please strictly follow the stat naming rules:
>**Stat_CategoryName_StatName**

The underscore separates the category name from the root and the stat name.


## Installation
Just download the sample project from here and use the contents of the StatsContainer folder.
